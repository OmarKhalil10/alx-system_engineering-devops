# alx-system_engineering-devops

This repository contains programs written for the system engineering and DevOps track at Alx SE program. In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. I update this repo with my learning progresses and hands-on projects as listed below:

* [0x00. sh - shell_basics](./0x00-shell_basics)
* [0x01. sh - shell_permissions](./0x01-shell_permissions)
* [0x02. sh - shell_redirections](./0x02-shell_redirections)
* [0x03. sh - shell_variables_expansions](./0x03-shell_variables_expansions)
